## Notes

- While the principle of explicability in AI is widely endorsed by industry and policymakers, this article questions its blanket application. It argues that the need for explicability should depend on the specific context and potential impact of a decision, rather than being a universal requirement for all AI systems. The discussion explores how overemphasizing transparency may unnecessarily limit the benefits of AI in low-risk scenarios.
